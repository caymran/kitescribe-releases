## 🖥️ Installation
1. **Download the installer**  
   From the [Releases](https://KiteScribe.ai) page:
   ```
   KiteScribe-UserSetup.msi
   ```
   > Defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\KiteScribe` (you can choose a different folder during setup).

2. **License Acceptance (Installer)**  
   During MSI installation you must accept the in-wizard EULA (`installer/EULA.rtf`) before the install can proceed.

3. **First Run**  
   The app checks for license - if exists waits for audio and captures screen when user selection is made.
   If license is not found - offers 5 minute trial - as well as instructs user on how to obtain/install license.

## 🔏 Release Signing
GitHub Actions now performs **DigiCert EV signing only for tag releases** (`refs/tags/v*`) to preserve the signing quota. 
- After signing, the workflow runs `signtool verify` against both `KiteScribe.exe` and `KiteScribe-UserSetup.msi` and fails the run if verification fails.

## 🚀 Usage Guide
### 1️⃣ Start the Application
Launch from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.  

### 2️⃣ Select Audio Source
Choose **Loopback** device from which to transcribe system sound.

### 3️⃣ Pick a Window
Click **🎯 Select Target Window** and choose any active window.  

### 4️⃣ Transcription
Speech and OCR results appear live in the app panes.

### 5️⃣ Exit Behavior
Closing the app stops capture.

## 🔐 Offline License Workflow
KiteScribe now enforces an **offline signed license** at startup.

### Runtime behavior
- The app looks for `kitescribe.license` next to `KiteScribe.exe`, then falls back to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/KiteScribe/license/kitescribe.license`.
- If no valid license exists, the app enters a 5-minute trial mode and then stops transcription while preserving transcript copy/export of captured text.
- A license is bound to a single machine fingerprint.
- A anti-rollback guard rejects license on backwards clock movement.
